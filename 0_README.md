#CLASSIFICATION PROJECTS:

1. Wine Quality Prediction:

I predicted the quality of wine based on the given features.
I used the wine quality dataset available on the Internet for free.
This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. 
By the use of several Machine learning models, I predicted the quality of the wine.

2. CreditCard Fraud Detection:

The project is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.
Challenges are:
Enormous Data, Imbalanced Data, Data availability(private data), and Misclassified Data.
By the use of the RandomFarestClassifier model without balancing data, I achieved an acceptable accuracy.

3. Disease Prediction:

This project aims to implement a robust machine-learning model that can efficiently predict the disease of a human,
based on the symptoms that he/she possesses.
The data set is from Kaggle.
I am predicting the disease for the input symptoms by combining the predictions of three models.
This makes our overall prediction more robust and accurate.

#RECOMMENDATION PROJECTS:

4. Movie Recommendation:

In This project, I created tailored content recommendations that improve user experience and take into account user preferences.
Through the utilization of collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid techniques, this system can offer customized recommendations to consumers for content, movies, or items.
This system uses sophisticated methods such as closest neighbors and matrix factorization to find hidden patterns in item attributes and user behavior.
