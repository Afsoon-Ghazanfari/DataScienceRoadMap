Classification Projects:

Wine Quality Prediction:
I predicted the quality of wine based on the given features.
I used the wine quality dataset available on the Internet for free.
This dataset has the fundamental features which are responsible for affecting the quality of the wine. 
By the use of several Machine learning models, I predicted the quality of the wine.

CreditCard Fraud Detection:
The project is to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.
Challenges are:
Enormous Data, Imbalanced Data, Data availability(private data), and Misclassified Data.
By the use of the RandomFarestClassifier model without balancing data, I achieved an acceptable accuracy.
